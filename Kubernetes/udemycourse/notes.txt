# when u create replicaset then u dont need to create separete pod file
# kubectl rollout status deploy or deployment queue
# kubecl rollout history deploy queue
# kubectl rollout undo deploy queue --to-revision=2
# default it will save 10 revesions, but the thingis that these roll backs dont reflect in the .yaml file 
# this is bad becaseue we want to be descritpitve aboute this
# use rollout for emergency purpose
# default deployment if u canged img name and thats incorrent it will not be affected by it becaude deployment check for health checks
